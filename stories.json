        "content": "Back in August, I got laid off unexpectedly. No warning, no severance, just a “hey, we’re restructuring” and a Zoom call that lasted 3 minutes. I panicked. Couldn’t tell my family yet. Didn’t want my friends or ex-coworkers to know. So I just… pretended I was still working.\n\nEvery day I’d “log in,” aka open my laptop and sit there like I was busy. Told people I had meetings. Walked around with AirPods in like I was on calls. Applied to jobs nonstop in the background. Even posted on LinkedIn occasionally about “exciting projects at work” just to keep the illusion going.\n\nThen something wild happened. A recruiter saw one of those fake posts, reached out, and asked if I was open to opportunities. I said yes. Got an interview. Lied through my teeth about the “current job.” Crushed the interviews. Got an offer higher salary, better title, remote, actual work-life balance.\n\nIt’s been five months now and I still haven’t told most people I was ever unemployed. Honestly? Don’t think I ever will.\n\nI used to feel guilty for faking it, but now I just feel… relieved. The system’s built on BS anyway. I just played along until it worked."
